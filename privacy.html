        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>This privacy policy applies to the UChiVerify app (hereby referred to as "Application") for web and Discord integration that was created by Dariel Cruz Rodriguez (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

        <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>The Application collects information when you use it. This information includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your Discord user ID</li>
            <li>Your UChicago CNET email</li>
            <li>The Discord server (guild) ID where you are requesting verification</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Service Provider will retain this information and use it solely for the purpose of verifying UChicago affiliates and troubleshooting purposes— should you have issues using the Service. The Service Provider does not collect, store, or process IP addresses, device information, or any location data.</p>

        <h2>Third Party Access</h2>

        <p>The Service Provider does not sell or share your personal information with third parties, and <strong>never will</strong>. Your Discord user ID, CNET email, and guild ID are only used for verification purposes and are stored securely. The Service Provider may disclose your information:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;</li>
            <li>when the Service Provider believes in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud and abuse of the Service, or respond to a government request;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>

        <p>The Service Provider will retain this limited information so you don't need to verify again in the future in the event you are in multiple servers that use UChiVerify, unless you decide to remove it. If you ever want your data deleted, just send an email to hello@dariel.us with the title "UChiVerify - Data Removal Request", and I'll take care of it as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>

        <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards are in place to protect the information the Service Provider processes and maintains.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. Changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the Application after any modification will constitute acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application or about the practices in general, please contact the Service Provider at hello@dariel.us.</p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>

        <p>This privacy policy is effective as of March 23rd, 2025. By using the Application, you consent to the processing of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
